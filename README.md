# MIGRATING FROM DANCER1

If you've been using Dancer1 before you might know [Dancer::Plugin::Swagger](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dancer::Plugin::Swagger).
Please note that that module's workflow is completely different! It is about
creating the spec from the app. The module described in this text is about
reading the spec and creating parts of the app for you.

# DEBUGGING

To see some more debug messages on STDERR set environment variable `OPENAPI_DEBUG`
to a true value.

# METHODS

## openapi( url => $url, ... )

Import routes from OpenAPI file. Named arguments:

- `url`: URL to passed to [Swagger2](https://metacpan.org/pod/Swagger2) module
- `controller_factory`: custom callback generator/finder that returns callbacks to routes
- `create_options_route`: autocreate additional route replying to OPTIONS requests based on Swagger data
- `validate_spec`: boolish value (default: true) telling if Swagger2 file shall be validated by official Swagger specification
- `validate_requests`: boolish value (default: same as `validate_spec`) telling if HTTP requests shall be validated by loaded specification (needs `validate_spec` to be true)
- `validate_responses`: boolish value (default: same as `validate_spec`) telling if HTTP responses shall be validated by loaded specification (needs `validate_spec` to be true)

## default\_controller\_factory

Default method for finding a callback for a given `operationId`. Can be
overriden by the `controller_factory` argument to `swagger2` or config option.

The default uses the `controller` argument/config option or the name of
the app (possibly with `::Controller` appended). If the `operationId`
looks like a Perl module the module name is tried under the namespace
mentioned above and as a top level module name.

The module warns as long as controller modules or methods can't be found
and returns a coderef on the first match.
